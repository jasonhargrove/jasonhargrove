      "👯‍♂️🏗 Met with one of our new contributors. Film production background with deep interests in building spaces for creators in the metaverse. Received great feedback about our mission in a hail of enthusiasm. Good vibes! 🙌👯‍♂️🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Awarded a couple X-Achievements to commemorate some big moments. 🙌👯‍♂️🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Was awarded an achievment badge by one of our producers they titled: \"The Closer\". In their words, it's because the team has been teeing me up, and I have been \"sealing the deal\". (consistently) ✍🏼👯‍♂ Distributed some updated content for the team."

      "🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Friday the 13 and nothing and it's good news only. A relationship we've been working on for months converted and they've joined us on our mission. (Sharing that mission with the public soon! Questions? I'm an open book: contact@jasonhargrove.com) 👯‍♂️🏗 Preparing discord for team expansion. Moving prototype channels around. New labs for each new member. The week is getting more and more dense, yo! 🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Voice call with Startup-Era-Day-1-OG-Team to reflect on our journey this year, and the changes unfolding rapidly. Shared first information about the project codenamed CORPO. Spoke about branding topics, and the upcoming design-team expansion."

      "🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps Architecture Day 2. AWS infrastructure, reviewing solutions for websockets with API Gateway and Beanstalk, and more 🏗⚙️🤖 A bit of time reviewing AWS new interfaces. 🏗⚙️🤖 The last of this week's architectural work, confirming we will continue to maintain our own node servers, particularly for open trustless use cases, and enterprise on-prem. Alongside our blockchain solutions. ✍🏼⚙️ Some time in Github issues on prototype tools and a couple new repos. ✍🏼👯‍♂ Connected with our finance lead on admin items, good chat as ever ✍🏼👯‍♂ Connected with the blockchain engineer we are onboarding, let's go! 👯‍♂️🏗 As I transition into product-focus this sprint, sent content to empower the team to be my eyes and ears when I'm down the rabbit hole in code. (A very focused, very anti-social state of being.) Created short-circuit mechanism to help me surface, so I can help keep everyone aligned. 📸📄 Fielded a use-request re some photographs, and shared with team as a real-time case study for something we are preparing for wide-release this summer. 📄🏗 Review of the January smart contract I wrote for Near blockchain, and the associated web UX. Considered how it will apply now and into the future. Preparing to share with the entire team in the coming weeks."

      "🙀📉 With the markets having a meltdown, had an early morning huddle with our finance lead. My message was simple: aside of the personal pain, the project is web3 yes but the volatility of crypto and the wider economy will not impede us. Long-term timeline, the trend has been Up Only, and our space is entirely the future.  🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps! More time in our codebases doing review and preparing. 🏗⚙️🤖 Total architectural review of our DevOps infrastructure underway, first iterations on the documentation for going to market. 🏗⚙️🤖 Transitioned one of our proto-services off of Heroku, finally shutting down Heroku (for good, probably). ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Wrote \"top-secret\" documentation regarding a project codenamed: CORPO. Early stage revenue games. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Wrote more onboarding content for team as we transition into full-fledged startup-mode. 🦅👯‍♂️ Collab with team on our scouting missions. We decided to get onboarded into LinkedIn's recruiter package. Seems pricey but seems useful ✅💹 Got inspired and wrote a bit of documentation about our pricing models. ✍🏼✨"

      "🔬🏗 Time to shift a little inward and carry some heavy weight for the crew on the product end. To help shift mental model, jumped into codebases from R&D labs. Running locally doing diagnostics and package security review. 🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps! Decided on a relay system so that the web can speak to the AI running on my local systems. Leaving it on a tab and will implement soon. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ More project management. Updates for team, coordination, and some training. Preparation for acceleration this week. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Content and lab adjustments in preparation to onboard new contributor, film producer background 🦅💥 Created an \"Eagle Strike\" X-Achievement and awarded it to a contributor who helped make some magic happen. Decisive action, with immediately favourable outcomes. LFG"

This version smooths out a few friction points and better prepares our team for finding their niche as the startup evolves. 🏗🤖 More time with product architecture in preparation for UX design and development sprints."

And coaching regarding recent evolutions regarding our norms. 🏅👯‍♂️🏅 Awarded a couple X-Achievements for the team, celebrating outstanding contributions. 🏅📊 Proposed an early-adopter multiplier in our incentives program, in recognition of the fast evolutions in our design process."

      "👯‍♂️🏗 Wrote the seed of a program that encourages contributors to \"go rogue\". Some studios say they celebrate people who take initiative, but in my experience few have tolerance for people who think outside of the box. When I say we want it, I mean it literally. This initiative codifies this ideal, and provides a framework for execution. Soon our robot producer will be outfitted with bot parts to support it within our systems. Distributed news of it amongst the team. 👯‍♂️🏗🏎🤖💭 Opened feature requests for Rogue v1, as well as for the robot being aware of our team momentum from sprint to sprint. 🏎🤖💭 Spent a bit of time giving feedback on our scouting missions. Otherwise got some rest, happy Saturday! ✨🚀"

      "🔭 Created a reconnaissance program for looking into DeFi projects similar to our space. Not a critical piece right now, but provides guidance for the team should they want to explore something with intention. 🦠🔬 A couple of us checked out something in crypto, which brushes up against our interests. It turned out pretty meh, but did spark a good discussion. Our biggest competitors are still very firmly in web2 land. Massive incumbants 👯‍♂️🔭👯‍♀️ Engaged with team about accelerating our scouting missions. Discussed ideals and parameters. Together we sketched an approach and began accelerating our actions 👯‍♂️🏗 Iterated on a content model for our project management; distributed to team 🤖🔭 Dug up new resources for GPT-3 and opened ticket for digging in next week 🧳🔭 Looked into acquisition opportunities using an interesting resource in web2 land, looking for low-hanging-fruit to expand our offerings (found nothing but will continue next time I have a free period) 🥳🎉 Took a moment to celebrate with the team, reflecting on how far we've come in such a short period. Truly I N C R E D I B L E. Reiterated mission and our next steps. TGIF"

      "📄✍🏼 This status log began with the goal of using GH to log my contributions, and then evolved into a bit of a blog — but there's simply too much happening. Fully switched to an internal solution which is hyper detailed. In coming weeks will have the robot producer use that data to assist me with this blog. In the meantime, will do my best to summarize and accept that my GH data is falling behind. The fix is going to be great 📗📚 Workshop re game theory, discussed pitfalls of zero-sum thinking. Gamification talk about establishing status around true collaboration and contribution. Challenged the team to become more well-versed in these topics and pledged to do the same 📄✍🏼 Documented an accessibility Epic with plans for app distribution 📄✍🏼 Documented UX for our Q2 release re data taxonomy; opened tickets 📄✍🏼 Updated the team with distribution ideology, setting team expectations ⚙️🏗♻️ Iterated on app design using our models. Things really heating up and becoming very real ⚙️🏗💎"
