      "👯‍♂️🎟 Connected with the legendary producer who brought me onto the film project that presented at Cannes and other festivals. Pitched helping me pull together more team. 🎟👯‍♂️ Had a great meeting with our finance team and covered more ground for upcoming plans. Everything is good vibes and the beginnings of great collaboration. 🎟👯‍♂️ Connected with the founder who originally got me interested in the blockchain, connecting the dots between happenings in the space and my R&D project Mainstream. We have great energy, both got excited about each other's progress. He's onboard to use our new Smart Contracts and loves the concepts. (Sharing soon.) 👯‍♂️🎟 Late-day scrum with team in preparation of some design and communications content we'll work on together tomorrow. ⚙️🪴 Finishing the day in code, preparing to go down the rabbit hole in the coming days — re UX of our next release. 🪴⚙️"

It's one of our fave apps — and as we gain momentum with our group comms, we're aiming to do something unusual with it. Sharing soon 🌞 Promoted content about Growth Loops and Hubspot's Flywheel. Wrote a bit about Customer Success. 🌞 Contributed more content for our recruitment campaign (open door: contact@jasonhargrove.com) 🌞 Scouted a dozen designers on Dribbble for game badge design (some great work in this batch) in preparation for pitches."

      "👯‍♂️⚙️⚙️⚙️ Beginning to see responses on our recruiting mission — very cool. The group's enthusiasm and curiosity is infectious. Want to cultivate that and reward it, so this morning iterated further on our acknowledgement models. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ Spent some time with onboarding content. Found a workable setup together, re our comms platforms; and for project management. Wrote a short draft for a contributor handbook and linked to Glitch's docs as a temporary solution on some of the tougher topics. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ As well as more docs for the finance team; began laying out architectural reqs on the smart contract side. End of day, just doing code review. A lot of code to port into this release. That only makes me kind of giddy. Great way to wrap this good Friday ⚙️⚙️⚙️👯‍♂️"
