      "⭐️⭐️ \"Crypto moves fast!\" people in web3 often say. 6 months in, wholeheartedly agree. Essential that our team moves fast. And we are! ⭐️ The seed team has come together — we're all in. Team and acceleration fund secured! ⭐️🥳 8.5 hours straight on phone calls today 👯‍♂, presenting clear vision 🔭, R&D programs and assets 📲🤖💭, and market findings from the era before 📈. (It took years to move this fast.) ⭐️⭐️ And there are many years ahead. A difficult journey, but confident we will cover more ground than most startups could dream of. ⭐️ This evening, reached out to some collaborators in my home markets: Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and NYC (just to start). ⭐️ Hi friends! If you see this, please reach out. Now is the time! ⭐️⭐️"

      "🌱💹 Today, learned how to terminate CAT5 cables and activated a dozen ports around the studio. Broadcast studio nearly ready; thrilled! 🚧🚧 Also was elaborating on product, in the weeds. Technical architecture and tasks. And light budget planning for the summer 🚧🚧 This afternoon and evening, some scrum with the seed team. For each other and recruitment, described a bit of a recipe beyond what can be written in job descriptions and tasks. 🚧 Our mandate is to build a team that can scale up and support each other, to play football together, and to work towards some early wins. For ourselves if for no other reason — but with the understanding that to win for ourselves, we need to elevate our team and win together. 🚧🚧 Today in the clearest terms, expressed the idea that everyone who comes aboard, for short or long term, carries the responsibility to leave the project better off, than it was when we joined. In return this is my commitment to each person on the team. The project leaves them better than they were before. 🚧 It's this vibration we want between us, and for our recruitment. 🚧🚧 This week we are evaluating each other to formally commit. And then it's time for each of us, and this seed team, to start to grow 🌱💹"

      "📸⚡️ (continued from yesterday) Was up literally all night, iterating on our plan like a machine. Really just clicked. Shipped to team this morning and I received jazz hands in reply 🎺🤗 Ready to go! Today marks the end of the second epic of 2022; a transitionary period. End of an era. 2016 until now. Ay! Yo 🤗💎 There's a certain form of populism on Twitter that decries the notion of \"leaning in\" and would like to \"deglamourize the hustle\". At best these folks are simply saying: \"That's not good for me.\" And, hey! Good for them 💎 Not one to glamourize anything, what I will say: if it wasn't for my hustle, over the very long term, none of what I wanted for this life would have come to pass. And some of what has passed boggles the mind! 💎 Listening to Drake right now, singing: \"Started from the bottom now we here. Started from the bottom now my whole team truckin here.\" 💎 And we are: Curious, Enthusiastic. Got Diamond Hands! 💎 Happy Easter friends. Will chill a little this long-weekend, while still keeping a little busy. Will not update this blog during this time, but today, I'm already looking forward to next week. \"Just getting started!\" 💎😉 Let's go!"

      "📸⚡️ Today in anticipation of adding members to our core-team, have been iterating on the Discord server, not just in architecture but in my own communications style. Really want to reach for the next level in how we communicate and collaborate. Slack and Discord are great but leave MUCH to be desired. In the previous update, I mentioned a use case for our robotics in this space. As we progress over the coming months, our own infrastructure will rank higher in importance for team comms. Today, settled on some patterns and set the tone. Let's see how it goes. 📸⚡️ Created a couple calendars for critical events, and proposed it as our guide. 📸⚡️ Also today, have been iterating on our alternate plan for our `Pre-Season` and something clicked in me and the seed team. ⚡️ Reworked Q2 ⚡️ will ship our PFP NFT project in Q3 ⚡️ enough time to execute at the highest level, and ship a few helpful things for the ecosystem before, is great for community. ⚡️📸  Meanwhile, this next epic is for a small family of products we think will be useful to everybody and our future selves 📸 --> Already mostly complete <-- 📸 --> tested in a few customer workspaces. <-- ⚡️📸 A few people around in 2016 and 2017, might get a kick out of what we have in store! ⚡️ Backing the app and bot layer: new smart contract needs to be written in Rust 📸  Project codename: `Smart Contributor Contract 1`. (A proof of work component that forms the basis of everything to ship this year and beyond.) ⚡️📸"

      "✍🏼🧐 We recently fleshed out a model for the Discord community. Great beginnings! Iterated a little on that setup, and expressed a preference to maintain separate hubs for community and core-team. Introduced the use of our AI as a bridge between these servers, and other services. People have different needs. Our robotics make different approaches for engagement possible, while maintaining connectivity as a whole. ✍🏼🧐 Wrote up an overview of our September playbook, and began onboarding the seed team into an early key stop along our roadmap. One of the more exciting initiatives in our `go-to-market` plan. Should be fun and the planned activities are the perfect muse for getting us moving on infrastructure development, marketing, sales and support. And product of course! ✍🏼🧐 Also finished up the roadmap for what we are referring to as our `Pre-Season`, and shared it with some people in our support network. `Season 1` will begin in October of this year (if all goes to plan). The Pre-Season began this past February, and is intended to escalate next week. Confirming in the coming days. Publishing public materials soon 🌞"
