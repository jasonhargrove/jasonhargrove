      "✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Wrote a state of the union and a personal stand-up for the team. ✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Another round of aligning the group re next steps. 🧹🏗 Some chores around the studio (Robot Lab 1), getting more of the Toronto lab unpacked and put into place. Spend some time with my main video rig and some assets in Blender for a compositing project we'll finish up soon. Got to start publishing in the next few weeks. ✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Spent time with new team members, laying the groundwork for upcoming executions. ✍🏼🏗 Sat down to catch up on 10 days of this blog. Painful! Grateful for our robot producer, who's been keeping track of it all. 🤖✨"

      "✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Sat down to iterate on architectural diagrams and content for our second blockchain engineering contributor. Expanding our bandwidth and preparing for a busy summer. The needs are light up-front so our primary intention now is onboarding and preparing the team for collaboration. 👯‍♂️👯‍♂️🏗 Great meeting with to kickstart that engineering expansion. I like to think of us as Robot Mechanics. In our ranks, there's another one! ✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Most of the day was project management, creating issues and tasks for new members. ✍🏼🏗👯‍♂️ Some collab with the OG team re fine-tuning their scouting missions."

Received great feedback about our mission in a hail of enthusiasm. Good vibes! 🙌👯‍♂️🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Awarded a couple X-Achievements to commemorate some big moments. 🙌👯‍♂️🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Was awarded an achievment badge by one of our producers they titled: \"The Closer\". In their words, it's because the team has been teeing me up, and I have been \"sealing the deal\". (consistently) ✍🏼👯‍♂ Distributed some updated content for the team."

(Sharing that mission with the public soon! Questions? I'm an open book: contact@jasonhargrove.com) 👯‍♂️🏗 Preparing discord for team expansion. Moving prototype channels around. New labs for each new member. The week is getting more and more dense, yo! 🙌👯‍♂️🙌 Voice call with Startup-Era-Day-1-OG-Team to reflect on our journey this year, and the changes unfolding rapidly. Shared first information about the project codenamed CORPO. Spoke about branding topics, and the upcoming design-team expansion."

      "🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps Architecture Day 2. AWS infrastructure, reviewing solutions for websockets with API Gateway and Beanstalk, and more 🏗⚙️🤖 A bit of time reviewing AWS new interfaces. 🏗⚙️🤖 The last of this week's architectural work, confirming we will continue to maintain our own node servers, particularly for open trustless use cases, and enterprise on-prem. Alongside our blockchain solutions. ✍🏼⚙️ Some time in Github issues on prototype tools and a couple new repos. ✍🏼👯‍♂ Connected with our finance lead on admin items, good chat as ever ✍🏼👯‍♂ Connected with the blockchain engineer we are onboarding, let's go! 👯‍♂️🏗 As I transition into product-focus this sprint, sent content to empower the team to be my eyes and ears when I'm down the rabbit hole in code. (A very focused, very anti-social state of being.) Created short-circuit mechanism to help me surface, so I can help keep everyone aligned. 📸📄 Fielded a use-request re some photographs, and shared with team as a real-time case study for something we are preparing for wide-release this summer. 📄🏗 Review of the January smart contract I wrote for Near blockchain, and the associated web UX. Considered how it will apply now and into the future. Preparing to share with the entire team in the coming weeks."

      "🙀📉 With the markets having a meltdown, had an early morning huddle with our finance lead. My message was simple: aside of the personal pain, the project is web3 yes but the volatility of crypto and the wider economy will not impede us. Long-term timeline, the trend has been Up Only, and our space is entirely the future.  🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps! More time in our codebases doing review and preparing. 🏗⚙️🤖 Total architectural review of our DevOps infrastructure underway, first iterations on the documentation for going to market. 🏗⚙️🤖 Transitioned one of our proto-services off of Heroku, finally shutting down Heroku (for good, probably). ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Wrote \"top-secret\" documentation regarding a project codenamed: CORPO. Early stage revenue games. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Wrote more onboarding content for team as we transition into full-fledged startup-mode. 🦅👯‍♂️ Collab with team on our scouting missions. We decided to get onboarded into LinkedIn's recruiter package. Seems pricey but seems useful ✅💹 Got inspired and wrote a bit of documentation about our pricing models. ✍🏼✨"

      "🔬🏗 Time to shift a little inward and carry some heavy weight for the crew on the product end. To help shift mental model, jumped into codebases from R&D labs. Running locally doing diagnostics and package security review. 🏗⚙️🤖 DevOps! Decided on a relay system so that the web can speak to the AI running on my local systems. Leaving it on a tab and will implement soon. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ More project management. Updates for team, coordination, and some training. Preparation for acceleration this week. ✍🏼👯‍♂️ Content and lab adjustments in preparation to onboard new contributor, film producer background 🦅💥 Created an \"Eagle Strike\" X-Achievement and awarded it to a contributor who helped make some magic happen. Decisive action, with immediately favourable outcomes. LFG"

This version smooths out a few friction points and better prepares our team for finding their niche as the startup evolves. 🏗🤖 More time with product architecture in preparation for UX design and development sprints."

And coaching regarding recent evolutions regarding our norms. 🏅👯‍♂️🏅 Awarded a couple X-Achievements for the team, celebrating outstanding contributions. 🏅📊 Proposed an early-adopter multiplier in our incentives program, in recognition of the fast evolutions in our design process."

      "👯‍♂️🏗 Wrote the seed of a program that encourages contributors to \"go rogue\". Some studios say they celebrate people who take initiative, but in my experience few have tolerance for people who think outside of the box. When I say we want it, I mean it literally. This initiative codifies this ideal, and provides a framework for execution. Soon our robot producer will be outfitted with bot parts to support it within our systems. Distributed news of it amongst the team. 👯‍♂️🏗🏎🤖💭 Opened feature requests for Rogue v1, as well as for the robot being aware of our team momentum from sprint to sprint. 🏎🤖💭 Spent a bit of time giving feedback on our scouting missions. Otherwise got some rest, happy Saturday! ✨🚀"
