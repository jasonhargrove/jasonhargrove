      "👯‍♂️⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙ Beginning to see responses, re recruiting mission, very cool. The group's enthusiasm and curiosity is infectious. Want to cultivate that and reward it, so this morning iterated further on our acknowledgement models. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ Spent some time with onboarding content. Found a workable setup together, re our comms platforms; and for project management. Wrote a short draft for a contributor handbook and linked to Glitch's docs as a temporary solution on some of the tougher topics. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ As well as more docs for the finance team; began laying out architectural reqs on the smart contract side. End of day, just doing code review. A lot of code to port into this release. That only makes me kind of giddy. Great way to wrap this good Friday ⚙️⚙️⚙️👯‍♂️"

      "✨🤗💬🤗 Hidden in plain sight, within these conversations, are teasers for our Q2 product (announcing soon). First feedback has been 1: startled 😯 2: intrigued 🧐✨. And where I've been able to transparently product reveal, the feedback quickly became 3: celebratory 🤗✨🤯✨🤗. This afternoon, shared today's journey with the team. A team that's loving it. \"Excited to pop this idea into existence with you!\" ✨ Documented plans to pitch the Q2 solutions also within brick-and-mortar spaces, as we roll out first for DeFi projects and teams in the digital space ✨ Also had a call with a fashion and homewares app founder and pledged technology support for their project, leveraging our Q2 concepts. ✨✨ Need our support? Let's go! Open door: contact@jasonhargrove.com 🤗💬🤗✨"

      "⚙️🪴 Great day, worked together to shape the Q2 product concepts into a life changing mission. Shipping this quarter for ourselves, and for our web3 communities. Something leading us towards the \"future of work\" — available for everybody. ⚙️🪴 More than this exploration, the core architecture leads directly into our Q3 and Q4 releases, where we will be working hard to onboard web2 creators, brands, and their communities into web3. Roadmap reveal, soon! ⚙️🪴 This evening, set rough release dates, and another round of iteration for the NFT project we've hinted at. ⚙️🪴 More early outreach for potential collaborators; and details for job descriptions. ⚙️🪴 And finally, today was also formalizing the details for our finance team. ⚙️🪴 Next up: a solid 1 to 1.5 months of design, engineering, and DevOps to ship (parallel to everything else that is escalating). Exciting times! ⚙️🪴"

      "⭐️⭐️ \"Crypto moves fast!\" people in web3 often say. 6 months in, wholeheartedly agree. Essential that our team moves fast. And we are! ⭐️ The seed team has come together — we're all in. Team and acceleration fund secured! ⭐️🥳 8.5 hours straight on phone calls today 👯‍♂, presenting clear vision 🔭, R&D programs and assets 📲🤖💭, and market findings from the era before 📈. (It took years to move this fast.) ⭐️⭐️ And there are many years ahead. A difficult journey, but confident we will cover more ground than most startups could dream of. ⭐️ This evening, reached out to some collaborators in my home markets: Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and NYC (just to start). ⭐️ Hi friends! If you see this, please reach out. Now is the time! ⭐️⭐️"
