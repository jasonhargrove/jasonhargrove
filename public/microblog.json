      "📸⚡️ Headed to ye ol' camera shoppe and picked up the new FTZ II, Nikon's mount adapter, which enables me to use ye ol' compliment of F-mount lenses on my Nikon Z bodies. Very nice. Sleek. A little surprised by how good it feels. (And none of the cost of the new Z lenses!) With the pandemic receding, going to get back out there ⚡️📸 Met with our finance lead, had a good talk about the future 📞⚡️ Began a bit of work in some legal docs to finish out the day ⚡️📄"

      "🗽🏥 This morning saw my outbound emails light on fire. General networking. Notable was a suggestion to a property developer for experimenting with come of our R&D in their world. (Concepts that came out of 601 W 26th Street, Chelsea, NYC where the Familiar R&D project began.) 🏥🤖💭 Polished up documentation for the finance team — shipped it. 📈🤖💬 Began preparing GitHub repos for team use. Moved around repos in our orgs. More code review. 🕵🏼📄 Created a Google Docs template for general-purpose use. Forked it and wrote an abstract declaring core architectural principles. This doc, informing coming marketing page and other materials. Wrote out the core essentials of our next releases. 📈📄 Worked with the team on pitch materials for recruiting game badge designers. 📧📄 Prepared three wires for DM-friendly PNGs — also the basis of a user oriented pitch-deck. Iterated on the DM script and wrote some suggestions for a very personal approach. 📄📧 Wrote code for our Discord Bot Part and called it a day! 🤖📈"
