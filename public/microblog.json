      "📸⚡️ (continued from yesterday) Was up literally all night, iterating on our plan like a machine. Really just clicked. Shipped to team this morning and I received jazz hands in reply 🎺🤗 Yo, ready to go! Today marks the end of the second epic of 2022; a transitionary period. End of an era. 2016 until now 💎 A certain form of populism on Twitter decries the notion of \"leaning in\" and would like to \"deglamourize the hustle\". At best these folks are simply saying: \"That's not good for me.\" And good for them! 💎 Not one to glamourize anything, what I will say: if it wasn't for my hustle, over the very long term, none of what I wanted for this life would have come to pass. And some of what has passed boggles the mind! 💎 Listening to Drake right now, singing: \"Started from the bottom now we here. Started from the bottom now my whole team truckin here.\" 💎 I and we are: Curious, Enthusiastic. Got Diamond Hands! 💎 Happy Easter friends. Will chill a little this long-weekend, while still keeping a little busy. Will not update this blog during this time, but today, I'm already looking forward to next week. \"Just getting started!\" 💎😉 Let's go!"

      "📸⚡️ Today in anticipation of adding members to our core-team, have been iterating on the Discord server, not just in architecture but in my own communications style. Really want to reach for the next level in how we communicate and collaborate. Slack and Discord are great but leave MUCH to be desired. In the previous update, I mentioned a use case for our robotics in this space. As we progress over the coming months, our own infrastructure will rank higher in importance for team comms. Today, settled on some patterns and set the tone. Let's see how it goes. 📸⚡️ Created a couple calendars for critical events, and proposed it as our guide. 📸⚡️ Also today, have been iterating on our alternate plan for our `Pre-Season` and something clicked in me and the seed team. We rewrote the Q2 roadmap and will ship our PFP NFT project in Q3, giving enough time to execute at the high level we want. This is ultimately what's best for our community as well. In Q2, we are pushing forward to release a family of products mostly complete in our R&D lab, previously tested in a few customer workspaces. For those who were around in 2016 and 2017, you'll get a kick out of what's planned! Under the app and bot layers is a new Smart Contract to write in Rust, codenamed: `Smart Contributor Contract 1`. A proof of work component that forms the basis of everything to ship this year and beyond."

      "✍🏼🧐 We recently fleshed out a model for the Discord community. Great beginnings! Iterated a little on that setup, and expressed a preference to maintain separate hubs for community and core-team. Introduced the use of our AI as a bridge between these servers, and other services. People have different needs. Our robotics make different approaches for engagement possible, while maintaining connectivity as a whole. ✍🏼🧐 Wrote up an overview of our September playbook, and began onboarding the seed team into an early key stop along our roadmap. One of the more exciting initiatives in our `go-to-market` plan. Should be fun and the planned activities are the perfect muse for getting us moving on infrastructure development, marketing, sales and support. And product of course! ✍🏼🧐 Also finished up the roadmap for what we are referring to as our `Pre-Season`, and shared it with some people in our support network. `Season 1` will begin in October of this year (if all goes to plan). The Pre-Season began this past February, and is intended to escalate next week. Confirming in the coming days. Publishing public materials soon 🌞"

      "The transition to ETH 2.0 is already one of the greatest stories of 2022 — good news sure to travel beyond crypto's borders. We're betting on it! ⛳ With lower network costs, expect to see much growth. And with the 99.98% reduced energy needs... to all my dear friends with deep concerns re environmental impact: time to celebrate! Ay! Let's get to work 🌞🌱 This afternoon the team gave me Plan A and Plan B, and while each have much merit, ETH's merge this summer is adding some bias. I weighed in with an opinion and volunteered to do some heavy lifting. Decision day coming soon ⛳️"

      "Proposed a scouting program for recruitment. Weekly contributions by the team to identify people that we respect and admire; in order to reach out and invite them to connect. People we want to work with, collab with, to have in our community, or have as customers. The bar so incredibly high, they are more likely to decline than to say yes 🎯"
