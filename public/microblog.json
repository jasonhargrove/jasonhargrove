      "So young when I started writing code, my only other skills involved Crayola crayons 💾🖼 As an adult I take it for granted but for no-code founders it might feel like those skills are everything. \"Crypto likes shipooors,\" is meme thinking that often leads folks to ship things that contain no value at all. Important to have more than one trick up one's sleeve, and excited tomorrow to play more of the other cards that help us grow 🌰🌱🌳  Meanwhile, this morning: I've been back in the lab again, iterating on smart contract code. (Because if I don't do it, nobody else will) 💘🖍📈"

      "It's not often I get to tell myself: \"Yes!\" 🚧 For quite some time I've been prioritizing other people's projects. Some were amazing (TAG Heurer Smart Watch? Hello!), and others just to fund long-term research. This week is one of those rare times I get to tell myself: Yes! A leap into an era entirely new. 🌰🌱 This afternoon, had a couple great calls with others saying, \"Yes!\" and in the coming days, two draft whitepapers merge into one, matched with a budget doc, and a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (or Equity)), and away we go 🌳 📈 Ayy! Yes!"
