      "Added a thin integration of our AI to the Lab 3 Discord server just now. 🤖⚡️ Before the pandemic I worked out of Starbucks very often, during my heavy R&D years in AI. (Building chat apps on social APIs such as Twitter, Messenger, Slack, Twitch and more. Voice bots using Alexa, Google Home, and hand-made smart speakers using Rasperry Pi and Arduinos. Automations built for workplace apps along the lines of Slack, Google Docs, and GitHub. And more! Behind these integrations, a core focus in machine learning was Natural Language Processing and Vision. It was an incredibly potent era; an explosion of technology. Summer 2016 to Winter 2020; what a time to be alive!) ⚡️🤖 Random people would often talk to me at the cafe, and at least 33% of the time someone would suggest that my work could destroy humanity. Like any decent Evil-Genius, I would laugh at that, rubbing my hands together maniacally, drawing out the moment performatively. But my response was generally far more benign and boring: \"Nah. This particular robot hypes stream communities, works with the streamer to give the audience a great in-chat experience, and also subtley creates the conditions that inspire people to donate. It's not that serious!\" But of course, for the streamers and other growth-minded people who were testing with me, it was pretty serious business. 🤖⚡️ In the next two years a lot of good will go public finally. 🤌🏼 Today with this internal Discord server integration, our AI will have a few simple duties to begin: auto-deleting messages in certain channels after a certain time, sharing status updates with the team, and gathering them from the team. Just a start."

      "Contributed a creative pitch, re community building. A bridge between a popular Solana NFT community and some of the robot parts in our lab. Our team's resident DeFi DeGen did a lot of great work to tee the concept up, I just took a swing at bat and something fun popped off. Potential home run? Only one way to find out... (The discussion then elaborated on creative direction and utility in our own PFP NFT concept. To reveal soon)"

      "Recently I met someone at Starbucks who identified themselves as a Socialist, and asked why I decided to become a Capitalist. 🤔 Had never considered it to be a choice. Never really thought of myself in that way. (😹 Kind of funny, having an economic theory as your core personal identity.) 🤔 Product designer. Software developer. Photographer. Artist. Content creator. Hardware hacker. Marketer. Salesperson. Project leader 🤔 Capitalist? Nah, just a builder, making things people want and need. (And surprise, surprise: they're willing to pay for that.) Where I founded businesses, it was because there were no other pathways open to me. Pretty straight forward, and not that deep. 🚧 This afternoon, more documentation and materials for the team. Then I'm deep in the code again. \"Seize the means of production? Hey! I AM the means of production!\""

      "This morning: tea talk with the founders club ☕️ Spoke about DeFi and gushed a little. The radical creativity and boundary-breaking for product development and business models in the space is unparalled. Easy to overlook if you're on the outside glancing in. 👀 Need to lower and eliminate the barriers of entry. 👀 Need to adapt solutions for a wider audience. 👀 Pledged to work hard to onboard everyone who wants in 🦄"

      "The Post-Apocalypse. A time better than the era before. That's what this Spring feels like, two years since the world was overnight put on hold. This afternoon, working on a roadmap for navigating the near future. A version for our seed team, a version for the public; and a mechanism along the lines of \"The Marauder's Map\" for revealing secrets to the community as the community grows."
