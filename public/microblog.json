      "Recently someone I met at Starbucks identified themselves as a Socialist and asked why I decided to become a Capitalist. I never considered it to be a choice, and never thought of myself in that way. (Imagine, having an economic theory as your core personal identity.) 😹 Product designer. Software developer. Photographer. Artist. Content creator. Hardware hacker. Project leader 🤔 Capitalist? Nah, just a builder, making things people want and need. (And surprise, surprise: they're willing to pay for that.) Where I founded businesses, it was because there were no other pathway open to me. Pretty straight forward, and not that deep. 🚧 This afternoon, more documentation and materials for the team. Then I'm deep in the code again. \"Seize the means of production? Girl I AM the means of production!\""

      "This morning: tea talk with the founders club ☕️ Spoke about DeFi and gushed a little. The radical creativity and boundary-breaking for product development and business models in the space is unparalled. Easy to overlook if you're on the outside glancing in. 👀 Need to lower and eliminate the barriers of entry. 👀 Need to adapt solutions for a wider audience. 👀 Pledged to work hard to onboard everyone who wants in 🦄"

      "The Post-Apocalypse. A time better than the era before. That's what this Spring feels like, two years since the world was overnight put on hold. This afternoon, working on a roadmap for navigating the near future. A version for our seed team, a version for the public; and a mechanism along the lines of \"The Marauder's Map\" for revealing secrets to the community as the community grows."

      "Sipping tea, sending messages. Had a dream that Barack Obama's mom announced her investment in our project at an important event (and immediately woke up in my excitement, before Barack weighed in. But easy to believe he's in too). Just outlined an idea we could call \"the Quests\", which could be core to our community programming. A plan to lead all \"wen token\" energy towards meaningful outcomes for all. AFK for a bit; then a half-day workshop with the team on our whitepaper. No blockers, up only!"
