Finishing the afternoon with some art direction on a Pinterest mood board (continuation of last week's efforts). Seems clear we will ship two separate but related products; already largely developed and tested in various aspects of our market over the past 10+ years. Tomorrow, discussions re go-to-market plan

Catching up with tech twitter VCs and NFT degens. Also went on LinkedIn– immediately regretted it 😹 Preparing for meetings today. Wondering how best to follow up with that meeting with Meta on Friday 🤭

Wrapped workshop 3 w/ crypto squad re a PFP NFT project we're hyped for, to kickstart the wider rollout. Seems like a green light one way or another, but aiming to bring on more support to speed up the announcement ✨✨✨ Stay Tuned

It's not often I get to tell myself: "Yes!" 🚧 For quite some time I've been prioritizing other people's projects. Some were amazing (TAG Heurer Smart Watch? Hello!), and others just to fund long-term research. This week is one of those rare times I get to tell myself: Yes! A leap into an era entirely new. 🌰🌱 This afternoon, had a couple great calls with others saying, "Yes!" and in the coming days, two draft whitepapers merge into one, matched with a budget doc, and a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (or Equity)), and away we go 🌳 📈 Ayy! Yes!

So young when I started writing code, my only other skills involved Crayola crayons 💾🖼 As an adult I take it for granted but for no-code founders it might feel like those skills are everything. "Crypto likes shipooors," is meme thinking that often leads folks to ship things that contain no value at all. Important to have more than one trick up one's sleeve, and excited tomorrow to play more of the other cards that help us grow 🌰🌱🌳  Meanwhile, this morning: I've been back in the lab again, iterating on smart contract code. (Because if I don't do it, nobody else will) 💘🖍📈
