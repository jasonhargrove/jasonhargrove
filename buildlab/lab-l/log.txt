It's not often I get to tell myself: "Yes!" 🚧 For quite some time I've been prioritizing other people's projects. Some were amazing (TAG Heurer Smart Watch? Hello!), and others just to fund long-term research. This week is one of those rare times I get to tell myself: Yes! A leap into an era entirely new. 🌰🌱 This afternoon, had a couple great calls with others saying, "Yes!" and in the coming days, two draft whitepapers merge into one, matched with a budget doc, and a SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (or Equity)), and away we go 🌳 📈 Ayy! Yes!

So young when I started writing code, my only other skills involved Crayola crayons 💾🖼 As an adult I take it for granted but for no-code founders it might feel like those skills are everything. "Crypto likes shipooors," is meme thinking that often leads folks to ship things that contain no value at all. Important to have more than one trick up one's sleeve, and excited tomorrow to play more of the other cards that help us grow 🌰🌱🌳  Meanwhile, this morning: I've been back in the lab again, iterating on smart contract code. (Because if I don't do it, nobody else will) 💘🖍📈

Sipping tea, sending messages. Had a dream that Barack Obama's mom announced her investment in our project at an important event (and immediately woke up in my excitement, before Barack weighed in. But easy to believe he's in too). Just outlined an idea we could call "the Quests", which could be core to our community programming. A plan to lead all "wen token" energy towards meaningful outcomes for all. AFK for a bit; then a half-day workshop with the team on our whitepaper. No blockers, up only!

The Post-Apocalypse. A time better than the era before. That's what this Spring feels like, two years since the world was overnight put on hold. This afternoon, working on a roadmap for navigating the near future. A version for our seed team, a version for the public; and a mechanism along the lines of "The Marauder's Map" for revealing secrets to the community as the community grows.

This morning: tea talk with the founders club ☕️ Spoke about DeFi and gushed a little. The radical creativity and boundary-breaking for product development and business models in the space is unparalled. Easy to overlook if you're on the outside glancing in. 👀 Need to lower and eliminate the barriers of entry. 👀 Need to adapt solutions for a wider audience. 👀 Pledged to work hard to onboard everyone who wants in 🦄

Recently I met someone at Starbucks who identified themselves as a Socialist, and asked why I decided to become a Capitalist. 🤔 Had never considered it to be a choice. Never really thought of myself in that way. (😹 Kind of funny, having an economic theory as your core personal identity.) 🤔 Product designer. Software developer. Photographer. Artist. Content creator. Hardware hacker. Marketer. Salesperson. Project leader 🤔 Capitalist? Nah, just a builder, making things people want and need. (And surprise, surprise: they're willing to pay for that.) Where I founded businesses, it was because there were no other pathways open to me. Pretty straight forward, and not that deep. 🚧 This afternoon, more documentation and materials for the team. Then I'm deep in the code again. "Seize the means of production? Hey! I AM the means of production!"

Contributed a creative pitch, re community building. A bridge between a popular Solana NFT community and some of the robot parts in our lab. Our team's resident DeFi DeGen did a lot of great work to tee the concept up, I just took a swing at bat and something fun popped off. Potential home run? Only one way to find out... (The discussion then elaborated on creative direction and utility in our own PFP NFT concept. To reveal soon)

Added a thin integration of our AI to the Lab 3 Discord server just now. 🤖⚡️ Before the pandemic I worked out of Starbucks often, during my heavy R&D years in AI. (Building chat apps on social APIs such as Twitter, Messenger, Slack, Twitch and more. Voice bots using Alexa, Google Home, and hand-made smart speakers using Raspberry Pi and Arduinos. Automations built for workplace apps along the lines of Slack, Google Docs, and GitHub. And more! Behind these integrations, a core focus in machine learning was Natural Language Processing and Vision. It was an incredibly potent era; an explosion of technology. Summer 2016 to Winter 2020; what a time to be alive!) ⚡️🤖 At the cafe random people would often talk with me, and if we got to talking about AI at least 33% of the time it was suggested that my work could destroy humanity. Like any decent Evil-Genius I would laugh at that, and rub my hands together maniacally, drawing out the moment performatively. "Nah. This particular robot hypes stream communities, works with the streamer to give the audience a great in-chat experience, and also subtley creates the conditions that inspire people to donate. It's not that serious!" But of course, for the streamers and other growth-minded people who were testing with me, it was serious business. 🤖⚡️ Soon and over the next two years, a lot of good digital gear will go public finally. 🤌🏼 Today with this internal Discord server integration, our AI will have a few simple duties to begin: auto-deleting messages in certain channels after a certain time, sharing status updates with the team, and gathering them from the team. Just a start.

Proposed a scouting program for recruitment. Weekly contributions by the team to identify people that we respect and admire; in order to reach out and invite them to connect. People we want to work with, collab with, to have in our community, or have as customers. The bar so incredibly high, they are more likely to decline than to say yes 🎯

The transition to ETH 2.0 is already one of the greatest stories of 2022 — good news sure to travel beyond crypto's borders. We're betting on it! ⛳ With lower network costs, expect to see much growth. And with the 99.98% reduced energy needs... to all my dear friends with deep concerns re environmental impact: time to celebrate! Ay! Let's get to work 🌞🌱 This afternoon the team gave me Plan A and Plan B, and while each have much merit, ETH's merge this summer is adding some bias. I weighed in with an opinion and volunteered to do some heavy lifting. Decision day coming soon ⛳️

✍🏼🧐 We recently fleshed out a model for the Discord community. Great beginnings! Iterated a little on that setup, and expressed a preference to maintain separate hubs for community and core-team. Introduced the use of our AI as a bridge between these servers, and other services. People have different needs. Our robotics make different approaches for engagement possible, while maintaining connectivity as a whole. ✍🏼🧐 Wrote up an overview of our September playbook, and began onboarding the seed team into an early key stop along our roadmap. One of the more exciting initiatives in our `go-to-market` plan. Should be fun and the planned activities are the perfect muse for getting us moving on infrastructure development, marketing, sales and support. And product of course! ✍🏼🧐 Also finished up the roadmap for what we are referring to as our `Pre-Season`, and shared it with some people in our support network. `Season 1` will begin in October of this year (if all goes to plan). The Pre-Season began this past February, and is intended to escalate next week. Confirming in the coming days. Publishing public materials soon 🌞

Planning
📸⚡️ Today in anticipation of adding members to our core-team, have been iterating on the Discord server, not just in architecture but in my own communications style. Really want to reach for the next level in how we communicate and collaborate. Slack and Discord are great but leave MUCH to be desired. In the previous update, I mentioned a use case for our robotics in this space. As we progress over the coming months, our own infrastructure will rank higher in importance for team comms. Today, settled on some patterns and set the tone. Let's see how it goes. 📸⚡️ Created a couple calendars for critical events, and proposed it as our guide. 📸⚡️ Also today, have been iterating on our alternate plan for our `Pre-Season` and something clicked in me and the seed team. ⚡️ Reworked Q2 ⚡️ will ship our PFP NFT project in Q3 ⚡️ enough time to execute at the highest level, and ship a few helpful things for the ecosystem before, is great for community. ⚡️📸  Meanwhile, this next epic is for a small family of products we think will be useful to everybody and our future selves 📸 --> Already mostly complete <-- 📸 --> tested in a few customer workspaces. <-- ⚡️📸 A few people around in 2016 and 2017, might get a kick out of what we have in store! ⚡️ Backing the app and bot layer: new smart contract needs to be written in Rust 📸  Project codename: `Smart Contributor Contract 1`. (A proof of work component that forms the basis of everything to ship this year and beyond.) ⚡️📸

📸⚡️ (continued from yesterday) Was up literally all night, iterating on our plan like a machine. Really just clicked. Shipped to team this morning and I received jazz hands in reply 🎺🤗 Ready to go! Today marks the end of the second epic of 2022; a transitionary period. End of an era. 2016 until now. Ay! Yo 🤗💎 There's a certain form of populism on Twitter that decries the notion of "leaning in" and would like to "deglamourize the hustle". At best these folks are simply saying: "That's not good for me." And, hey! Good for them 💎 Not one to glamourize anything, what I will say: if it wasn't for my hustle, over the very long term, none of what I wanted for this life would have come to pass. And some of what has passed boggles the mind! 💎 Listening to Drake right now, singing: "Started from the bottom now we here. Started from the bottom now my whole team truckin here." 💎 And we are: Curious, Enthusiastic. Got Diamond Hands! 💎 Happy Easter friends. Will chill a little this long-weekend, while still keeping a little busy. Will not update this blog during this time, but today, I'm already looking forward to next week. "Just getting started!" 💎😉 Let's go!

studio networking
🌱💹 Today, learned how to terminate CAT5 cables and activated a dozen ports around the studio. Broadcast studio nearly ready; thrilled! 🚧🚧 Also was elaborating on product, in the weeds. Technical architecture and tasks. And light budget planning for the summer 🚧🚧 This afternoon and evening, some scrum with the seed team. For each other and recruitment, described a bit of a recipe beyond what can be written in job descriptions and tasks. 🚧 Our mandate is to build a team that can scale up and support each other, to play football together, and to work towards some early wins. For ourselves if for no other reason — but with the understanding that to win for ourselves, we need to elevate our team and win together. 🚧🚧 Today in the clearest terms, expressed the idea that everyone who comes aboard, for short or long term, carries the responsibility to leave the project better off, than it was when we joined. In return this is my commitment to each person on the team. The project leaves them better than they were before. 🚧 It's this vibration we want between us, and for our recruitment. 🚧🚧 This week we are evaluating each other to formally commit. And then it's time for each of us, and this seed team, to start to grow 🌱💹

⭐️⭐️ "Crypto moves fast!" people in web3 often say. 6 months in, wholeheartedly agree. Essential that our team moves fast. And we are! ⭐️ The seed team has come together — we're all in. Team and acceleration fund secured! ⭐️🥳 8.5 hours straight on phone calls today 👯‍♂, presenting clear vision 🔭, R&D programs and assets 📲🤖💭, and market findings from the era before 📈. (It took years to move this fast.) ⭐️⭐️ And there are many years ahead. A difficult journey, but confident we will cover more ground than most startups could dream of. ⭐️ This evening, reached out to some collaborators in my home markets: Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and NYC (just to start). ⭐️ Hi friends!

⚙️🪴 Great day, worked together to shape the Q2 product concepts into a life changing mission. Shipping this quarter for ourselves, and for our web3 communities. Something leading us towards the "future of work" — available for everybody. ⚙️🪴 More than this exploration, the core architecture leads directly into our Q3 and Q4 releases, where we will be working hard to onboard web2 creators, brands, and their communities into web3. Roadmap reveal, soon! ⚙️🪴 This evening, set rough release dates, and another round of iteration for the NFT project we've hinted at. ⚙️🪴 More early outreach for potential collaborators; and details for job descriptions. ⚙️🪴 And finally, today was also formalizing the details for our finance team. ⚙️🪴 Next up: a solid 1 to 1.5 months of design, engineering, and DevOps to ship (parallel to everything else that is escalating). Exciting times! ⚙️🪴

👯‍♂️⚙️⚙️⚙️ Beginning to see responses on our recruiting mission — very cool. The group's enthusiasm and curiosity is infectious. Want to cultivate that and reward it, so this morning iterated further on our acknowledgement models. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ Spent some time with onboarding content. Found a workable setup together, re our comms platforms; and for project management. Wrote a short draft for a contributor handbook and linked to Glitch's docs as a temporary solution on some of the tougher topics. 👯‍♂️⚙️👯‍♂️ As well as more docs for the finance team; began laying out architectural reqs on the smart contract side. End of day, just doing code review. A lot of code to port into this release. That only makes me kind of giddy. Great way to wrap this good Friday ⚙️⚙️⚙️👯‍♂️
